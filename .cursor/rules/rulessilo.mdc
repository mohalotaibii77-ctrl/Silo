We are building a multi-tenant Restaurant Operating System similar to Foodics, but everything works inside a single unified platform.

The system architecture is:

(1) One backend
Contains all microservices: POS, inventory, HR, accounting, operations, QHSE, maintenance, training, customer care, and the AI Core.
The backend controls all business logic and provides APIs for multiple restaurants (multi-tenant).
The backend also includes the data warehouse + audit logs + AI models.

(2) SuperAdmin Frontend
Used only by us (platform owner).
We use it to create new businesses, manage subscriptions, control access, monitor system-wide analytics, and manage support.

(3) Business Frontend (Restaurant App)
This is the main app used by each restaurant.
The frontend contains multiple user interfaces depending on the role:

Owner UI: dashboard, HR, inventory, operations, accounting, AI reports.

Operations Manager UI: daily tasks, checklists, shifts, incidents, waste, EOD.

Employee UI: check-in, tasks, uploads, training, issues.

The system is NOT dependent on external POS or external accounting software — our backend includes both POS logic and accounting logic internally.

All modules (POS, Inventory, HR, Operations, QHSE, Accounting, AI) are internal backend microservices connected through the API Gateway and served to the Business Frontend.

The Business Frontend is where all operational activity happens.
The SuperAdmin Frontend is for platform-level control.
The backend is the single engine powering everything.



This APP solely uses the project Silo from our database. Dont edit or do anything to other projects.

When I ask you to do something, implement and then give a brief summary within the chat, do not create a document unless it is a requirement that we need.


the backend should be Modular Monolith
